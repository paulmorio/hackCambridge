# A Small Research Hack: Clustering and Visualisation of Protein Interaction Networks

Protein interaction networks are an incredible bed for hypothesis generation for potential studies into interactions of specific proteins whose interactions are unknown by looking at the way they are clustered, as this can hint towards protein complexes or functional interactions. The challenging part of this hack was implementing This small reseach hack implements five different algorithms
